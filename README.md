A fully object-oriented casino simulation written in C++, featuring two classic games: Roulette and Blackjack. The project demonstrates complex OOP design, including class inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, operator overloading, and custom exception handling.

With numerous header and source files working together, the project models real-world casino mechanics — including players with account balances, betting systems, score tracking, game outcomes, and operator-based interactions. Designed as a large-scale console application, this project highlights advanced C++ design patterns and system architecture.
